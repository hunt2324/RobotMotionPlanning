""" Definitions:

configuration (q): a 2D planar rigid body configuration, specified using (x, y)
                   of the origin of the local frame w.r.t. global frame, and
                   an angle theta. q = (x, y, theta)

control (u): Specified using u = (ux, uy, uth), expressed w.r.t. local frame.
             u = (1, 0, 1) means drive forwards (current local x), omega = 1

configuration velocity (qd): The control, transformed into the global frame.
                             qd = (xd, yd, thd)

transform (T): A homogeneous transform matrix expressing a configuration,
               coordinate transform, or rigid body motion

Things we want to compute:

  -- compute transform from from configuration: transform_from_config
  -- compute configuration from transform: config_from_transform
  -- compute tranform from control + duration: transform_from_control
  -- compute transform from sequence of controls and durations:
         transform_from_sequence
